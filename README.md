# Hello World! ğŸ‘‹

My name is Luca Junge and I'm a web developer. Feel free to contact me on [Github](https://github.com/LucaJunge), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LJ_3D) or on my [website](https://luca-junge.de).

Iâ€™m interested in all things web, from current web design trends to full stack application development. I'm also interested in computer graphics, photogrammetry and 3d scanning.
I have experience with three.js to display and create various applications.
